%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% INSTRUCTIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Below you will be able to find a few examples for the most common types of references (articles, books and websites). Please ensure the reference follows the same format if you are writing it yourself. However, especially with articles, you might be better off finding the 'cite this reference' button on the website. 

% You can cite using \cite{name-of-entry}. The 'name-of-entry' is the part after the first line. For this for example below, citing would work like: \cite{Example-Article}. Once you have cited the source at least once in the text, the entry will appear in the bibliography at the end.

% For a cheat sheet with all entry types and much more, see http://tug.ctan.org/info/biblatex-cheatsheet/biblatex-cheatsheet.pdf
